# Gametracker

## Overview
For project #2, I created a game tracker app. This app allows users to track and share upcoming games for any sports team. Users are able to add any team from any sport and then add upcoming games for that specific team. Users can also view other user's teams and games. 

Gametracker consists of the following models: user, team, and game. The User model has full CRUD capabailities while the other two models have Add/Delete capabilities.
